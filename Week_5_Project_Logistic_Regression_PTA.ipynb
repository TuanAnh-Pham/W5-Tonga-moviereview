              "'Three giant sabretooth tigers(..created in a laboratory from mitochondrial DNA, a \\\\genetic breakthrough\\\\\" derived from fossil material)are on the rampage accidentally set free through a series of events(such as a computer geek\\'s introduced virus in order to unlock security measures keeping the resort novelty shops closed during construction & a security guard\\'s leaving a gate open while searching for the missing page from a porn mag that flew away in the breeze)that threaten the lives of those it comes in contact with. The tigers are always hungry, but are unable to digest what they eat. So pretty much the tigers just rip their prey to shreds. Victims include a group of college kids(..the stereotypes include a goth girl, jock and tech nerd), security personnel, and those somewhat developed rich scoundrels who we can easily despise and wish horrible death.<br /><br />Rounding out a series of bad sci-fi channel flicks, Attack of the Sabretooth has some of the most wretched computer simulated animals I\\'ve seen yet. And, the final death sequence is so putridly presented, you\\'ll demand within the deepest recesses of your soul the time spent on this truly awful exercise in the creature feature canon. There\\'s some good dark humor deriving from heads being torn from necks, but even here the prosthetic work is unconvincing. Prosthetic body parts and blood aplenty as victims are pounced upon, crying for help and receiving none. I\\'m starting to sound like a broken record, repeating myself in every user comment I write for these sci-fi channel flicks. I think maybe it\\'s time to move on to other kinds of cinema. Robert Carradine has a role as a ruthless businessman who is being wooed by his truly repellent ex-brother-in-law, Nicholas Bell, the one opening \\\\\"Primal Park\\\\\", a resort / zoo featuring genetically created sabretooth tigers as it\\'s major attraction. Stacy Haiduk, still quite yummy, is a security officer who attempts to convince Bell to get the investors he hopes to goad into putting money in his multi-million dollar project to leave the island. Brian Wimmer is Haiduck\\'s lover and his role is a mechanic keeping operations running smoothly.<br /><br />Bell\\'s fate at the end, resulting from a dislodged tooth from a sabretooth tiger statue is the pits. Carradine spends a great deal of the film taunting Bell, his arch nemesis. The tiger\\'s point-of-view shows humans in a bright color as it moves towards them. The film ultimately consists of characters walking through darkened corridors(..the tech nerd\\'s virus cut off the power)worried for their safety. The college kids commit breaking and entering to score certain items needed(..it\\'s a scavenger hunt type of activity)to enter a fraternity / sorority. The cast playing these kids do not rise above their clichÃ©s.\"'"

Here\\'s a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading \\\\In the future...\\\\\" is going to be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.<br /><br />In this case, \\\\\"In the future...\\\\\" means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine, well, that\\'s never terribly clear, but it\\'s probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists, i.e. \\\\\"us\\\\\") and bad guys (Commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots.<br /><br />Sadly, the effects budget was pretty slim, so we don\\'t get to see a lot of the big robots. There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. The space fight is especially nice, as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.<br /><br />With said money now spent, the climactic fight degenerates into (and I\\'m not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.<br /><br />Like I said-it\\'s dumb.

            "To \\Bend It Like Beckham\\\" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to \\\"Hit it Like Bonds\\\" or \\\"Dunk it Like Jordan.\\\" Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a clichÃ© moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.\"\n"
